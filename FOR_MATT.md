POINTS TO TALK ABOUT WITH MATTHEW JOSIAH EBENEEZER BREALEY

- The placement of the big function within Play.svelte as noted

- Look into why my Arduino isn't being detected once plugged in after script is run

- Why declaring neonColour CSS variable in :root works for Welcome.svelte, but
  didn't work when doing the same in PLay.svelte (so had to declare them in html)

- How to get slider track to overlap to the left (so still displaying when value = 0)

- How to put a variable within the box-shadow so glow is prop. to value (I tried the
  format 0px 0px var(--glow) 10px with "--glow: {number}px" but no worky)

- Can't seem to get rid of the padding: Even when setting padding: 0 within the
  style sheet for the body, it's still giving a 8px padding (have tried using
  !important tag and declaring it within html {  } with nae luck)

- I know my results page looks different to the design brief, but we're heading out
  now and I don't have the time to put in a slider with initial values as the final
  values and then disable the slider so its just for display. So that's how I'd do
  it. I _could_ do it tomorrow and send it across after, but I'd like you to have a
  look at the code before we meet up tomorrow. So that's my excuse. And it's a good
  one. So there. Words.
