POINTS TO TALK ABOUT WITH MATTHEW JOSIAH EBENEEZER BREALEY

- Once quitting the game, I can't seem to get it going again. The game progress
  store looks correct when we restart, and the app flows okay... it just doesn't
  seem to talk to the led anymore (which it should because there's nothing server
  side I can think of would stop it doing so)... have I missed something obvious
  or is this linked to why it won't detect the Arduino if connected after script
  run...?

- Goddamn I tried removing the event dispatchers as you said. I broke everything
  and have attempted to piece it back together... seems to work... but sorry I
  couldn't package all the functions outside the components :-(

- The placement of the big function within Play.svelte as noted

- Look into why my Arduino isn't being detected once plugged in after script is run

- I really like declaring variables inside the css code (as one can do with standard
  JS) rather than inline within the html bit at the bottom of each component

- How to get slider track to overlap to the left (so still displaying when value = 0)

- I know my results page looks different to the design brief, but we're heading out
  now and I don't have the time to put in a slider with initial values as the final
  values and then disable the slider so its just for display. So that's how I'd do
  it.
